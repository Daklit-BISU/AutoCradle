The "Autocradle" is a device designed to help parents with newborn babies by automating the swinging motion of a cradle and detecting crying or excessive movement using a microphone and motion sensor. The goal of the "Autocradle" is to provide some assistance to parents during the demanding and exhausting early months of parenthood by helping to soothe their babies and potentially providing some alerts for parents.

# Implementation

We have simulated our project using CoppeliaSim V-REP to test and refine the design and functionality of the "Autocradle".

# Key Features

Device provides the following features:

- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4

# Safety and reliability

The "Autocradle" has been designed with safety and reliability in mind. All components and materials used in the device have been carefully selected to meet appropriate safety standards, and the device has been thoroughly tested in simulation to ensure that it works as intended.
